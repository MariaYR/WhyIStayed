**Project Summary**

This repository contains the most recent version of the #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft topic model analysis. 
The project uses proprietary data from Twitter (purchased by researchers) and as such data is not shareable in its raw form. 
However, replication requests can be made here and I will work with investigator(s) to provide data for reproducability.
